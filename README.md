## Text Classification 2

The objectives of this assignment are to gain experience with Keras, text classification, deep learning model variations, and embeddings. 
The code for this project was written using Python3 on Jupyter Notebook. 
The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle.com database, and the goal was to split the CSV file into trainingand testing sets and then create a graph 
illustrating the distribution of the target classes.
The data set was also described to determine what the model should predict. Afterward, a sequential model was created and evaluated on the test data. 
To improve the model's performance, alternative architectures such as RNN, CNN, and others were explored and evaluated on the test data.
Different embedding approaches were also tried, and their performance on the test data was evaluated. 
Finally, an analysis of the performance of various approaches was provided.
Overall, the project aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of text classification, deep learning models, and embeddings, 
as well as to develop practical skills using Keras for implementing these concepts. Please feel free to check the [pdf](https://github.com/afaf-guesmia/Text-Classification-2/blob/main/Text%20Classification%202.pdf)
